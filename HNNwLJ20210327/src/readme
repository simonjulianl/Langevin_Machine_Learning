more clean code
- add explain each code..
1. uml update
2. data_io at utils folder
don't use def read_endpts_qp and write_endpts_qp
3. linear_integrator at integrator folder
make code for only do integrator
4. MC_sample.py <- create data_io obj for write init qp file
5. MD_sample.py <- create data_io obj for
                   * read init qp
                   * write, read trajectory file to solve overuse memory
