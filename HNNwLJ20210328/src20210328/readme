more clean code
- add explain each code..

2. data_io at utils folder
change open file to torch.save
3. linear_integrator at integrator folder
make code for only do integrator
4. MC_sample.py <- create data_io obj for write init qp file
5. MD_sample.py <- create data_io obj for
                   * read init qp
                   * write, read trajectory file to solve overuse memory
6. make dataset.py, use in ML_pair_wise.py
do only split data for input in ML

plan
dataLoader.py  : only for load data (label also)


still doing... X(
